//Instruções para configurar VI
Install plugins manually (Vim 8 and above)
A Vim package is a directory containing one or more plugins. By default, your Vim settings are contained in ~/.vim, 
so that's where Vim looks for plugins when you launch it. (The examples below use the generic name vendor to indicate 
that the plugins are obtained from an entity that is not you.)

When you start Vim, it first processes your .vimrc file, and then it scans all directories in ~/.vim for plugins contained in pack/*/start.

By default, your ~/.vim directory (if you even have one) has no such file structure, so set that up with:

$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start

Create .vimrc file in your home directory



Now you can place Vim plugins in ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start, and they'll automatically load when you launch Vim.


For example, try installing NERDTree, a text-based file manager for Vim. First, use Git to clone a snapshot of the NERDTree repository:

$ git clone --depth 1 \
  https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree.git \
  ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/nerdtree
Launch Vim or gvim, and type this command:

:NERDTree
A file tree will open along the left side of your Vim window.
