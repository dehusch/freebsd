pkg install -y nano

pkg install -y xorg

pkg install -y xfce

pkg install -y slim slim-themes

pkg install DRM-KMOD

sysrc dbus_enable=YES

sysrc hald_enable=YES

sysrc slim_enable=YES

  --->>>insert the line
  exec startxfce4
  
pkg install -y firefox htop gimp

reboot

#NON TESTED WAY
#
pkg install xfce


# cd /usr/ports/x11-wm/xfce4
# make install clean

dbus_enable="YES"

% echo ". /usr/local/etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc" > ~/.xinitrc

/etc/ttys:
ttyv8   "/usr/local/bin/xdm -nodaemon"  xterm   off secure

Then enter # pkg install drm-kmod
Enter the easy editor to edit the file /etc/rc.conf by entering the following command: # ee /etc/rc.conf
Once in the easy editor, on a new line, enter the following: kld_list=”/boot/modules/i915kms.ko”
Make sure to hit Enter so the file starts on a new line after saving.
Save and exit the easy editor by pushing Esc and following the prompts to save and exit. The KMS driver should now be set up.
Now install Xorg by following 5.3 Installing Xorg in the Handbook. Enter # pkg install xorg
Because the KMS driver was set up, one can skip ahead in the Handbook to 5.7.3. Xfce. To install the Xfce package, enter # pkg install xfce.
Enter the easy editor again to edit /etc/rc.conf by entering the following: # ee /etc/rc.conf
On a new line, enter dbus_enable=”YES”
After entering the above, hit Enter so the file starts on a new line. Then hit Esc and follow the prompts to save and exit.
Start the /etc/rc.conf lines by entering # service dbus start
Next, enter # kldload /boot/modules/i915kms.ko
Simply rebooting would also achieve steps 13 and 14.
If one didn’t reboot, enter # exit to leave the superuser account.
If everything worked, one should see the Xfce desktop after running % startx as a regular account.
