Wacom Tablets under FreeBSD

These instructions are correct as of FreeBSD 13.

Install

Install:

    multimedia/webcamd (v3.9.0.5 or newer)
    x11/libwacom
    x11-drivers/xf86-input-wacom
    x11-servers/xorg-server (need HAL support) 

Configuration

In /boot/loader.conf, make sure you have:

cuse_load="YES"

(Note: this used to be "cuse4bsd_load".)

In /etc/rc.conf, make sure you have:

webcamd_enable="YES"

(Note: Older versions of FreeBSD may have also required devd_enable="YES" and hald_enable="YES" as well.)

Restart devd, and add your user to the webcamd group:

# service devd restart
# pw group add webcamd
# pw groupmod webcamd -m <username>

At this point you may need to disconnect and reconnect your tablet.
