The Plank Preferences and Quit menu items can be accessed 
by right cliking near the edges (left/right) of the dock. 
Or you can hold down the Ctrl key and right click anywhere 
on the Plank dock.

You can install Plank themes downloaded from such websites by placing them in:

~/.local/share/plank/themes for your current user (doesn't require root/sudo)
/usr/share/plank/themes for all users (root/sudo needed to install them)


In case you download an archive, extract it and place the theme folder in 
the directory of your choice from the two listed above.

You don't need to restart Plank. After installing a new Plank theme, open 
the Plank preferences and you'll find the new theme there, ready to be used.
